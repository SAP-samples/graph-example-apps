# 🎯 What you will learn 
In today's workshop you will gain a first overview of SAP Graph and how it can increase productivity in your development projects.

We want to teach you how to interact with SAP Graph's APIs. 
Since you probably already use some frameworks to build applications like SAP UI5, Angular, Flutter, React etc. 
we intentionally use plain HTML+JS as our focus is on the API itself and the OData syntax we support. 
SAP Graph aims to be compatible with as many open-source or commercial frameworks out there as possible. 

Do you have any feedback how we can best support your development activities? Please reach out to us 📬
